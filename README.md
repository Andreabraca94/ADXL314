Check the product and its datasheet [here](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl314.html).

The ADXL314 is a ±200 g range, 13-bit resolution, 3-axis digital accelerometer. The digital output data is formatted as 16-bit, twos complement data and is accessible through a serial peripheral interface (SPI), 3-wire or 4-wire, or an I2C digital interface.
An integrated memory management system with a 32 level, first in, first out (FIFO) buffer can store data to minimize host processor activity and lower overall system power consumption.
Low power modes enable intelligent motion-based power management with threshold sensing and active acceleration measurement at low power dissipation, typically 65 μA for VS = 2.5 V at a 100 Hz output data rate (ODR).
The ADXL314 is supplied in a small, thin 5 mm × 5 mm × 1.45 mm, 32-lead LFCSP.
